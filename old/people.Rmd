(Principal Investigator)  
My research is focused on the intersection between traits, geographical distribution and historical and spatial diversification in flowering plants, and my long term goal is to understand the general rules that link these three components through flowering plant evolution. I am also a fan of Myrtales and of the tropical flora, and am keen to fill gaps in our understanding of the biology of poorly known plant lineages.

<font size="4">Sandra Reinales, MSc</font>  
(PhD student - USP, Brazil)
Sandra is a botanist interested in systematics, biogeography and morphological evolution, in a macroevolutionary context. Currently, Sandra is a PhD student at USP (Brazil), where she studies diversification dynamics in the tribe Sauvagesieae (Ochnaceae). She is testing some mechanisms (e.g. dispersal capacity) that could explain the unbalanced species richness and the recent geographical distribution of Neotropical Ochnaceae, focusing on the montane areas of South America. In her spare time Sandra is also interested in historical collections of colombian botanists. spreinales@gmail.com | [Sandra's Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sandra_Reinales) | [Sandra's Twitter](https://twitter.com/spreinales)

<font size="4">Lílian Melo, MSc</font>  
(UFU, Brazil)  
Lílian is a PhD student in ecology with a great interest in plant-pollinator interactions and macroevolutionary questions related to this topic. Currently, her research is mainly focused on the classification, evolution and distribution of species with pollen flowers. lilian.melo@ufu.br | [Lilian's Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?hl=pt-BR&user=EpdBsl4AAAAJ) | [Lilian's Twitter](https://twitter.com/LilianRFMelo) | [Lilian's ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lilian_Rodrigues_Ferreira_De_Melo)

<font size="4">Patrícia Sperotto, MSc</font>  
(UEFS, Brazil)  
Patrícia is a botanist whose research focuses primarily on climbing plants. In her MSc, she revised the terminology used to describe the climbing habit and explored the role of climbing mechanisms (e.g., tendrils, twining stems, prehensile petioles) in the evolution, diversification and distribution of neotropical climbing plants. She is currently looking for a PhD to further develop her skills in macroevolution, phylogenetic comparative methods and biogeography. patriciassperotto@gmail.com | [Patricia's twitter](https://twitter.com/P_Sperotto) | [Patricia's ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patricia_Sperotto)
