## Hello!
#
I'm a postdoc based at the Beaulieu lab, University of Arkansas. 

Address:
Department of Biological Sciences, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701, USA
Email: 
tvasc@uark.edu

Key words: biogeography, botany, macroevolution, neotropics, Myrtales, systematics, trait evolution.


You can also contact me anytime in my personal email: thais.nogales@gmail.com 
(Nogales is my first surname, but I use Vasconcelos for publications. Vasconcelos is my last surname. Brazilians have lots of surnames. I know, it's confusing.)
