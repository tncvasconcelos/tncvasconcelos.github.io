Currently, our research lab is focused on two key areas of study:

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p>
<style> body {text-align: justify} </style> 
  
We aim to investigate the evolution of plants in under-researched tropical regions and groups, with a particular focus on lineages within the Myrtales order (which includes plants such as guavas, pomegranates, and cloves). By utilizing a range of methods including field observations, experiments, trait measurements, and phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses, we are able to gain a comprehensive understanding of how the environment has influenced the evolution of this plant group and how different Myrtales lineages are related to one another. Our multidisciplinary approach allows us to uncover new insights and fill in the knowledge gaps in our understanding of ecology and evolution in tropical ecosystems.

Trait-environment correlation analyses allow us to uncover general patterns in plant biogeography by measuring how unrelated plant lineages have evolved similar traits in response to a specific environment. To accomplish this, we utilize natural history collections and trait characterization tools to gather large sets of occurrence data and functional traits. These datasets are then combined with molecular phylogenies and phylogenetic comparative methods to quantify the correlation between traits and environments throughout the evolution of flowering plants.
